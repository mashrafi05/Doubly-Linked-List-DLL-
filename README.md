# Doubly-Linked-List-DLL-
This project was completed as an assignment in my Data Structures course. It involves implementing a Doubly Linked List (DLL) in C++. The project demonstrates core operations on this data structure, such as inserting, deleting, and searching nodes, as well as finding the maximum and minimum values.
